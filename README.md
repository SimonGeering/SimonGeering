# A bit about me

I'm a software developer working mainly in London and the south east of the UK for the last 20 years.

With my early career working with SQL Server and VB6 COM desktop apps, I developed a focus on Microsoft tools and technologies.

In the .Net era I now predominantly code in C# and TypeScript with a back-end bias due to my interest in working on systems integration and Azure cloud migration problems for enterprise back-office applications.

Moving into more senior and team-lead roles now a days I also find myself working on CI/CD build pipeline YAML and Azure powershell scripts etc, while still happy to jump into some T-SQL whenever the DBA needs a hand or Entity Framework won't suffice.

## What's on my GitHub?

The following is a quick overview of the various bits and bobs you'll find on my GitHub, from my personal pet PDM app project (Admin Assistant), through to various small code samples and any forks of OSS projects im actively working on contributions for.

### [Admin Assistant](https://github.com/SimonGeering/AdminAssistant)

This is my main personal project that is closest to the sort of code i work on professionally. It gives me somewhere safe (i.e not in works codebase ðŸ˜„) to try new technologies and techniques on an enterprise grade system with sufficient real world complexity.

Whilst it's always going to be WIP, the core backend web-api is well under way at the time of writing. The various UI projects are POC / Prototypes at the moment and there is a lot missing in terms of non-functional capabilities, such as security, better error handling, logging & instrumentation etc.

The architecture and focus of efforts on the Web-API has been so I can easily try out new UI frameworks with minimal additional effort in future. It also uses has a larger than typical number of third-party packages in use, reflecting its experimental / RnD nature.

### Family Tree

This is a private repo of my fathers where he is developing a python desktop application to work with all the data needed to record our Family Tree. I have helped with advice on architecture, data modeling and TDD as well as code contributions to the business domain and infrastructure.

It has been an interesting learning experience coding in a language i don't normally work with.

### [CasinoGames](https://github.com/SimonGeering/CasinoGames)

Inspired by a Twitch streamer writing a java version of blackjack as a TDD stream, I started development of what may become a set of casino / card games in .Net. The project currently contains the initial WIP implementation of TDD C# blackjack as well as a dice / random number generator module.

### [SamplesAndCodeKatas](https://github.com/SimonGeering/SamplesAndCodeKatas)

I tend to use this project to back-up / share any code samples i may need to put together quickly for some RnD to to help Jnr devs. It also contains sub-folders for any code katas i've worked on.
